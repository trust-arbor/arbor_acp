  @moduledoc """
  Characterization gate for the Codex ACP adapter's permission and
  elicitation wire behavior (area A3 of `docs/POST_1_0_MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md`,
  "Codex adapter restructuring" / "Characterization gate").

  Each test drives `ArborACP.Adapters.Codex` through `ArborACP.Test.CodexGolden`
  and compares the recorded transcript against a committed fixture under
  `test/fixtures/acp/codex/permissions/`. The fixtures pin:

    * the ACP `session/request_permission` request (tool call, option set,
      `_meta`) produced for every app-server approval request the adapter
      handles - `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` (default decisions,
      execpolicy amendments, network approval context and policy amendments,
      additional permissions, explicit `availableDecisions`),
      `item/fileChange/requestApproval`, `item/permissions/requestApproval`,
      the legacy `execCommandApproval` / `applyPatchApproval` aliases, and
      `mcpServer/elicitation/request` on the permission fallback (persist
      options from `_meta.persist`, unknown scopes filtered);
    * command option-set normalization and validation: the stable
      allow-before-reject sort of explicit `availableDecisions`, an explicit
      `availableDecisions: null` falling back to the defaults, the network
      context taking precedence over `additionalPermissions`, an explicit
      `acceptForSession` on an `additionalPermissions` request, network
      amendment option indices following the explicit decision order (and
      the reply being mapped by that same order), non-map network
      amendments being ignored, and every fail-closed shape (duplicate ids,
      no allow or no reject decision, amendments without their context, an
      empty execpolicy amendment, a network amendment whose action is
      neither `allow` nor `deny` or whose host/action pair was not proposed)
      answering `cancel` without an ACP request;
    * `_meta.permission` carrying no `description` when the reason is blank
      or not a string (the blank case is pinned by the whole request: a
      mutation that makes `trimmed_permission_text/1` return `""` instead of
      `nil` is wire-equivalent because `maybe_put/3` delegates to
      `ArborACP.Adapters.Internal.Maps.put_non_empty/3`, which drops `""` as well as
      `nil`; only a variant that emits the untrimmed whitespace is
      observable, and that one is caught), the legacy tool call id
      precedence `itemId` > `callId` > `approvalId`, approval / user-input
      requests without a `threadId` being routed to the only open session,
      and `threadId` winning over `sessionId` when both name an open session;
    * the exact native decision written back for every ACP reply shape:
      each selected option, a cancelled outcome, an unknown option id, a
      malformed result, an ACP error response, and replies for unknown,
      already-answered, or server-resolved request ids; a non-object
      `permissions` profile granting an empty profile;
    * `item/tool/requestUserInput` form elicitation round trips, including
      secret-field and missing-capability refusals (a boolean `form`
      capability counts as missing), `_note` id collisions, blank
      note text falling back to the selected option, an empty-string
      answer omitting its question, the request message winning over a
      single question's text, `required` omitted when every question is
      optional, `isOther` without options or with an explicit empty options
      list, and a request without any questions;
    * `mcpServer/elicitation/request` in form mode (legacy `enumNames`
      normalization, the `openai/form` fallback, `toolCallId` / `sessionId`
      precedence, `threadId` winning over `sessionId`, the default tool
      call title on the permission fallback) and url mode (the default
      prompt, completion of the accepted client UI via
      `serverRequest/resolved`, concurrent url elicitations, requests without
      an `elicitationId` never being completed, and a resolved url
      elicitation being forgotten so that neither a duplicate resolution nor
      a later `session/close` completes it a second time);
    * `serverRequest/resolved` dropping pending user-input and form
      elicitation entries so late client replies write nothing;
    * the native error for unsupported app-server requests;
    * the ChatGPT device-code login flow and its request-scoped url
      elicitation, including completion without client consent, the no-code
      prompt for an empty `userCode`, and the default failure message when
      `account/login/completed` carries no error;
    * the `approvalsReviewer` / approval policy wire params `turn/start`
      carries per session mode.

  Adapter-generated ACP request ids are normalized to placeholders such as
  `"codex-permission-<1>"`; step functions answer them with the real id via
  `ArborACP.Test.CodexGolden.generated_ids/1`.

  To regenerate a fixture after an intentional behavior change, run the test
  with `CODEX_GOLDEN=update mix test <this file>[:line]`; that run rewrites the
  fixture and fails on purpose, so review the diff and re-run without the
  variable to confirm.

  @moduledoc """
  Characterization gate for the Codex ACP adapter's cancellation and fault
  handling wire behavior (area A6 of `docs/POST_1_0_MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md`,
  "Codex adapter restructuring" / "Characterization gate").

  Each test drives `Arbor.ACP.Adapters.Codex` through `Arbor.ACP.Test.CodexGolden`
  and compares the recorded transcript against a committed fixture under
  `test/fixtures/acp/codex/faults/`. The fixtures pin:

    * `session/cancel` with an active turn (the `turn/interrupt` write, the
      swallowed interrupt reply, and prompt settlement on the following
      `turn/completed`), with an explicit `turnId` (a non-string or blank one
      falls back to the session's turn), and without an active turn, an
      unknown session, or a `sessionId`;
    * `session/close` and `session/delete` for idle, active, unknown, and
      already-closed sessions: the interrupt / unsubscribe / archive writes,
      the immediate `stopReason: "cancelled"` prompt response, the native
      cancel result written for every pending client request of that session
      (and only that session), `elicitation/complete` for accepted url
      elicitations, and the fencing of later notifications and app-server
      requests for the closed id (including the id-less and `sessionId`-keyed
      events that escape the fence, and a session re-opened by `session/load`
      accepting events again);
    * `session/close` issued while the `turn/start` reply is still
      outstanding: the pending entry is not pruned, so a late success reply
      silently re-creates the closed session (a later `session/cancel` and a
      second `session/close` succeed and the prompt is answered a second time)
      and a late error reply answers the already-cancelled prompt again;
    * app-server responses for unknown ids and late duplicates, and the error
      reply for every pending request type (`thread/start`, `thread/resume`,
      `thread/list`, `turn/start`, `thread/compact/start`,
      `account/login/start`, `model/list`, `turn/interrupt`,
      `thread/unsubscribe`, `thread/archive`, `account/logout`);
    * ACP replies for unknown, already-answered, or server-resolved client
      requests, ACP error replies to every pending client request kind (each
      writes that kind's native cancel result), `serverRequest/resolved` for
      an id with no pending entry, duplicate app-server requests sharing a
      native id, and ACP messages the adapter does not handle;
    * app-server requests for an open session the adapter refuses natively
      with `-32601 "Unsupported app-server request: <method>"` (the named
      `item/tool/call`, `account/chatgptAuthTokens/refresh` and
      `attestation/generate` methods as well as an unknown one), and
      `item/tool/requestUserInput` answered `{answers: {}}` at once when the
      client lacks form elicitation or a question is `isSecret`;
    * `serverRequest/resolved` for an accepted url elicitation: only that
      flow's `elicitation/complete` is emitted, a second accepted flow stays
      open and completes on `session/close`;
    * `thread/closed` / `thread/archived` notices reported as session
      metadata while the session is open and fenced after `session/close`;
    * malformed, partial, and otherwise unclassifiable inbound lines;
    * `session/prompt` for an unknown or closed session, and notifications
      and app-server requests for a never-opened session.

  Failed-turn settlement (`turn_failure` / `capacity_failure`, error codes
  -32029 / -32030 / -32031) is characterized by the session_updates area, not
  here.

  Client-side request timeouts, subprocess exit, and port closure are owned by
  `Arbor.ACP.Client` and `Arbor.ACP.AdapterBridge`, not by the adapter (it
  never expires a pending request and only fences by state), so they are
  deliberately not characterized here.

  Adapter-generated ACP request ids are normalized to placeholders such as
  `"codex-permission-<1>"`; step functions answer them with the real id via
  `Arbor.ACP.Test.CodexGolden.generated_ids/1`.

  To regenerate a fixture after an intentional behavior change, run the test
  with `CODEX_GOLDEN=update mix test <this file>[:line]`; that run rewrites the
  fixture and fails on purpose, so review the diff and re-run without the
  variable to confirm.

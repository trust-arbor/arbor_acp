defmodule ArborACP.Adapters.Pi.ControlGroupOrderTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression test for the order in which subprocess exit fails pending
  control groups.

  Control-group ids are minted as `"group-N"` from the VM-wide
  `System.unique_integer([:positive, :monotonic])` counter. Exit handling
  used to take `Map.values/1` of the groups, i.e. the lexicographic order of
  those strings, so two groups straddling a digit boundary (`"group-999"`,
  `"group-1000"`) were failed in reverse order. The golden
  `exit_fails_active_prompt_and_control_groups_then_cancels_queue` scenario
  only hit that when concurrent tests happened to push the counter across a
  boundary between its two `session/new` requests.

  Not async: the test positions the shared counter right below a power of
  ten, so no other test may consume monotonic integers concurrently.

defmodule ExACP.Test.ClaudeGolden do
  @moduledoc """
  Golden-transcript harness for characterizing `ExACP.Adapters.ClaudeSDK`.

  Every step drives one public adapter callback (`init/1`, `command/1`,
  `env/1`, `post_connect/1`, `auth_methods/1,2`, `capabilities/0`, `modes/0`,
  `config_options/0`, `list_sessions/2`, `fork_session/2`,
  `translate_outbound/2`, `translate_inbound/2`) with the state threaded from
  the previous step. The harness records what the adapter *did* at each step
  (SDK lines written to Claude Code, ACP messages, replies, errors) and never
  records the adapter state itself, so fixtures pin wire behavior rather than
  internal state layout.

  The Claude adapter is not adapter-managed: `command/1` returns an
  executable and args for the bridge to spawn, and the adapter implements
  neither `handle_adapter_message/2` nor `shutdown/1`. Subprocess exit and
  transport teardown are owned by `ExACP.AdapterBridge` and are therefore
  not reachable from this harness (see the faults area moduledoc).

  ## Sandbox

  `run/2` creates a private sandbox directory per run and removes it when the
  test exits. Its layout is:

      <sandbox>/bin/claude          fake `claude` executable (see "Fake CLI")
      <sandbox>/bin/claude-failing  fake `claude` that exits non-zero
      <sandbox>/claude/             Claude config dir (`claude_config_dir`),
                                    holding `projects/<key>/<uuid>.jsonl`
      <sandbox>/project/            working directory (`cwd`)

  Two placeholders may appear anywhere in a step (init options, messages,
  file paths) and are substituted with real values before the step executes,
  then normalized back when the transcript is rendered:

    * `"<sandbox>"` - the sandbox directory;
    * `"<sandbox-key>"` - the sandbox directory in the SDK's project-key
      form (every non-alphanumeric character replaced by `-`), so a session
      store path is written as
      `"<sandbox>/claude/projects/<sandbox-key>-project/<uuid>.jsonl"`.

  `default_init_opts/0` points `cwd`, `claude_config_dir` and `cli_path` into
  the sandbox and `{:init, opts}` is merged over those defaults. The harness
  refuses (`flunk/1`) any of those three options, any `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
  passed through `:env`, and any `params["cwd"]` of an outbound request that
  does not live inside the sandbox, so no scenario can read the developer's
  real Claude configuration, credentials, sessions, or projects. The
  normalizer additionally rewrites the user's home directory to `"<home>"`
  and `assert_golden/4` fails if that placeholder ever reaches a fixture.

  ## Environment

  `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` (the `cli_path` fallback) and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
  (the session store fallback) change the adapter's behavior without an
  option override, so `run/2` fails with a clear message when either is set.
  `auth_methods/1,2` additionally branches on `NO_BROWSER`, `SSH_CONNECTION`,
  `SSH_CLIENT`, `SSH_TTY` and `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`; an `:auth_methods` step
  fails when any of them is set, and the remote branch is deliberately not
  characterized (it is only reachable by mutating the OS environment, which
  would race every other async test).

  ## Steps

    * `{:init, opts}` - `ClaudeSDK.init(Keyword.merge(default_init_opts(), opts))`.
      When the first step is not `:init` the defaults are used.
    * `:post_connect` - `ClaudeSDK.post_connect(state)`.
    * `{:outbound, map | fun}` - `ClaudeSDK.translate_outbound(map, state)`.
    * `{:inbound, map | fun}` - `ClaudeSDK.translate_inbound(Jason.encode!(map), state)`.
    * `{:inbound_raw, string}` - `ClaudeSDK.translate_inbound(string, state)` verbatim.
    * `{:respond_control, subtype, response}` / `{:respond_control_error,
      subtype, error}` - an `:inbound` `control_response` correlated with the
      most recent control request of that `subtype` written so far
      (`control_request_id/2`); the step is recorded as `:inbound` with the
      resolved message.
    * `{:list_sessions, params}` - `ClaudeSDK.list_sessions(params, state)`.
    * `{:fork_session, params}` - `ClaudeSDK.fork_session(params, state)`.
    * `{:command, opts}` / `{:env, opts}` - `ClaudeSDK.command/1` and
      `ClaudeSDK.env/1` over `Keyword.merge(default_cli_opts(), opts)`.
    * `{:auth_methods, opts}` - `ClaudeSDK.auth_methods(opts, state)`;
      `{:auth_methods_fresh, opts}` - `ClaudeSDK.auth_methods(opts)`.
    * `:capabilities`, `:modes`, `:config_options` - the static callbacks.
    * `{:write_file, path, content}` - writes a sandbox file before the next
      adapter call (`content` is a string, a map rendered as JSON, or a list
      of maps rendered as JSONL); parent directories are created.
    * `{:read_file, path}` - records `%{exists: boolean, content: term}`
      where JSONL content is decoded line by line and anything else is kept
      verbatim.
    * `{:note, text}` - recorded verbatim, no adapter call.

  A `fun` (accepted by `:outbound`, `:inbound`, `:fork_session`,
  `:write_file` and `:read_file`) receives the *raw* transcript recorded so
  far (real ids intact) and returns the map or path to use; the resolved value
  is what gets recorded. A `:fork_session` fun is how a scenario forks at a
  `messageId` an earlier step actually put on the wire.

  ## Request ids

  ACP requests the adapter sends to the client (`session/request_permission`,
  `elicitation/create`, `fs/read_text_file`) carry an id minted by
  `ExACP.Internal.JSONRPC.generate_id/0`, a bare monotonic integer that
  starts at 1 in a fresh VM. To keep scenario ids and adapter ids apart, an
  `"id"` supplied by a step must be a string unless it is an integer the
  adapter already minted (which is how a reply step answers a request);
  anything else is refused with `flunk/1`.

  ## Transcript entries

  Each entry is an `ExACP.Test.ClaudeGolden.Entry` struct (a map with `:step`
  and `:result`), so fixtures render the cause (`step`) before its effect
  (`result`). `:result` holds only the keys that apply: `tag` (the adapter's
  return tag), `writes` (SDK lines written to Claude Code), `messages`,
  `reply` (a JSON-RPC result, or the value of a plain callback such as
  `capabilities/0`), `error`, `skipped`, `exists`, `content`.

  ## Wire framing

  SDK writes are recorded as JSON-decoded maps for readability, but the
  NDJSON framing produced by `ExACP.Adapters.ClaudeSDK.Protocol.line/1`
  is enforced on every write before decoding: the iodata must be empty or
  consist of JSON objects each terminated by exactly one `"\\n"`. A write
  whose final object lacks its terminator, or that contains an empty line,
  raises rather than silently producing the same transcript.

  The `ExACP.Adapter` behaviour also allows `{:ok, :pending, state}`,
  `{:one_shot, fun, state}` and `{:partial, state}`. The Claude adapter never
  returns them and `normalize_result/1` deliberately has no clauses for them;
  a step that produced one raises a `FunctionClauseError` here, which is the
  right signal to extend the harness.

  ## Normalization

  Before a transcript is returned, written, or compared, entries are walked
  in order (each entry's `step` before its `result`; inside a map the sorted
  keys as well as the values) and:

    * the sandbox path (in both its literal and symlink-resolved form, which
      differ on macOS) is replaced by `"<sandbox>"`, its project-key form by
      `"<sandbox-key>"`, and the user's home directory by `"<home>"` (the
      last is a tripwire: it must never appear in a fixture);
    * control request ids minted by the adapter
      (`"ex_mcp_set_permission_mode_12"`), generated ACP session ids
      (`"claude_sdk_13"`) and the tool-call id minted for a permission
      request that carries none (`"tool_14"`) are replaced by placeholders
      that preserve identity within the transcript: the first distinct id of
      a kind becomes `..._<1>`, the next `..._<2>`, and the same real id
      always maps to the same placeholder;
    * an integer under an `"id"` key - always adapter-minted, see "Request
      ids" - becomes `"acp-<1>"`, `"acp-<2>"`, ... the same way;
    * a UUID first seen in a step is a scenario literal and is kept verbatim;
      a UUID first seen in a result was minted by the adapter
      (`SessionStore.fork_session/2`) and becomes `"<forked-1>"`;
    * a `"fileSize"` becomes `"<bytes>"`: a session transcript embeds the
      sandbox path, whose length differs per run and per machine, so the
      byte count is pinned only as present;
    * ISO-8601 timestamps within one day of the run (session `updatedAt`
      values derived from file mtimes) become `"<now>"`; timestamps written
      by scenarios must therefore be dated in the past;
    * anonymous functions are replaced by `:__fun__` so fixtures stay
      evaluable.

  ## Fake CLI

  `<sandbox>/bin/claude` is a shell script that prints `Logged out.` and
  exits 0, and `<sandbox>/bin/claude-failing` prints `not authenticated` and
  exits 3. `session/logout` runs `cli_path auth logout` unless the adapter
  was started with `logout_cli: false`, so both outcomes are characterized
  without any chance of invoking the developer's real `claude` binary.

  ## Fixtures

  `assert_golden/4` compares the transcript with
  `test/fixtures/acp/claude/<area>/<name>.term`. Run the test with
  `CLAUDE_GOLDEN=update` to (re)write the fixture; that run always fails so
  regeneration is a deliberate, reviewed act.

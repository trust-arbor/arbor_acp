  - Provide examples where helpful (commands, directory paths, naming patterns).
  - Maintain a professional, instructional tone.

  Recommended Sections

  Project Structure & Module Organization

  - Outline the project structure, including where the source code, tests, and assets are located.

  Build, Test, and Development Commands

  - List key commands for building, testing, and running locally (e.g., npm test, make build).
  - Briefly explain what each command does.

  Coding Style & Naming Conventions

  - Specify indentation rules, language-specific style preferences, and naming patterns.
  - Include any formatting or linting tools used.

  Testing Guidelines

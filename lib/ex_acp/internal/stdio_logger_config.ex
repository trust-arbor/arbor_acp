defmodule ExACP.Internal.StdioLoggerConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Configures logging for the MCP stdio transport so stdout stays JSON-RPC only.

  `configure/0` mutates VM-global Logger, Application, and OTP logger
  behavior: it sets `:ex_acp` `:stdio_mode`, the Elixir `Logger` level, the
  `:logger` application env, and the OTP primary logger level to
  `:emergency`. The change is process-wide for the BEAM VM, not scoped to
  the stdio connection. Unrelated host-application logging is suppressed.

  1.x keeps this global behavior so stdio protocol output stays
  uncontaminated. 2.0 may replace it with a dedicated IO device and stderr
  logging.

  This module is internal. Do not call it from application code unless you
  intend to apply the same VM-global configuration.

  Configures logging for STDIO transport to prevent stdout contamination.

  The MCP STDIO transport requires that ONLY JSON-RPC messages appear on stdout.
  This function suppresses all logging to ensure clean protocol communication
